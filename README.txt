Purpose of parts 1 and 2: practice conditional logic, user input handling, and output formatting in Java.

Part 1: 
Objective: 
A program that calculates the average of three test scores and displays the corresponding letter grade using if if-else condition.
Test cases:
Input 1 : 
Enter score 1: 85
Enter score 2: 90
Enter score 3: 80
Output 1:
Enter score 1: 85
Enter score 2: 90
Enter score 3: 80
Average: 85.0
Grade: B
Input 2:
Enter score 1: 90
Enter score 2: 95
Enter score 3: 91
Output 2:
Enter score 1: 90
Enter score 2: 95
Enter score 3: 91
Average: 92.0
Grade: A
Input 3:
Enter score 1: 50
Enter score 2: 65
Enter score 3: 70
Output 3:
Enter score 1: 50
Enter score 2: 65
Enter score 3: 70
Average: 61.666666666666664 ( this is my problem, I have to fix, I believe, for easier reading)
Grade: D
Input 4:
Enter score 1: 20
Enter score 2: 20
Enter score 3: 20
Output 4:
Enter score 1: 20
Enter score 2: 20
Enter score 3: 20
Average: 20.0
Grade: F

Challenging: Formatting numbers is the hardest part

Part 2:

Objective: 
This program asks the user for the number of checks written, applies a base fee and per-check fee, then outputs the total monthly service charge.
Test cases:

Input 1:
Enter number of checks: 35
Output 1: 
Enter number of checks: 35
Base fee: $10.0 ( I tried to fix this, but it doesn’t work)
Fee per check: $0.08
Total service charge: $12.80
Input 2:
Enter number of checks: 40
Output 2:
Enter number of checks: 40
Base fee: $10.0
Fee per check: $0.06
Total service charge: $12.40
Input 3:
Enter number of checks: 61
Output 3: 
Enter number of checks: 61
Base fee: $10.0
Fee per check: $0.04
Total service charge: $12.44

Challenge faced: I can’t format $10.00
